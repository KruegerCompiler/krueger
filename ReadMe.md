# Krueger

Elm is a pretty awesome language and platform. It's a platform we like, but the elm community has a specific vision.

Here at krueger-compiler, we have a somewhat skewed vision of what the Elm platform can be.

Imagine a world where Elm:

- Had a more open interop story
- Played better with non-Elm tooling
- Played nicer with other languages and platforms

That vision is where krueger fits.

It might be a darker more nightmarish version of Elm than you are used to, but our name is krueger for a reason ðŸ˜‰ ðŸ‘¿.
